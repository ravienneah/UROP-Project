> *Hi Ravienne! This is an R Notebook document. You don't have to use this format, but I like to! R Notebook is basically a way of presenting your code in a final document which is easier to read and can be easily edited within R.*

#### Loading packages 
```{r echo=T,include=F,results='hide'}
library(tidyverse) # includes dplyr
library(forcats) # i added this bc i was having trouble with factors
```
tidyverse - includes dplyr


forcats - i added this bc i was having trouble with factors


#### Here's where I loaded my data locally


```{r echo=TRUE,include=T,results='hide'}
load(
  "~/Desktop/QPL/urop_ravienne/ICPSR UROP Data/ICPSR_21600 4/DS0005/21600-0005-Data.rda"
)

## **Zoe's first edit of code (tweaked code style + resolved errors)**
Pro tip! pressing control/command if you have a mac + shift + the a key will reformat your code to make it easier to read :) That was the thing only I tweaked about R's code above <33

### Step 1:selecting the variables from each wave and organizing them

```{r}
#wave 1 variables
data_wave1 <- da21600.0001 |> 
  select(
    AID, H1TO12, H1TO17
    )
#wave 2 variables
data_wave2 <- da21600.0005 |> 
  select(
    AID, H2ED19, H2ED17, H2PR1, H2PR2, H2PR3, H2PR4
    )
#wave 4 variables
data_wave4 <- da21600.0022 |>
  select(
    AID,
    H4MA1,
    H4MA3,
    H4MA5,
    H4TO51,
    H4TO58,
    H4TO46,
    H4TO48,
    H4TO52,
    H4TO47,
    H4TO53,
    H4TO54,
    H4TO55,
    H4TO56,
    H4TO59,
    H4TO60,
    H4TO61,
    H4TO62
  )
```

### Step 2:  merging the variables by AID
```{r}
data_waves1and2 <- merge(
  data_wave1, 
  data_wave2, 
  by = "AID"
  )
data_waves124 <- merge(
  data_waves1and2,
  data_wave4,
  by = "AID"
  )
```

### Step 3: Using the dplyr function mutate to combine variables from subvariables e.g. ACEs

```{r}
#aces :
data_waves124$emotional_abuse <- as.numeric(data_waves124$H4MA1 == "(5) (5) More than ten times")

data_waves124$physical_abuse <- as.numeric(
  data_waves124$H4MA3 == "(3) (3) Three to five times" |
    data_waves124$H4MA3 == "(4) (4) Six to ten times" |
    data_waves124$H4MA3 == "(5) (5) More than ten times"
)

data_waves124$sexual_abuse <- as.numeric(data_waves124$H4MA5 != "(6) (6) This has never happened")
data_waves124 <- data_waves124 |>
  mutate(aces = emotional_abuse + physical_abuse + sexual_abuse)
```

```{r}
#problematic substance use - create a manual diagnosis variable and send dr liu the codebooks
```

### Still Step 3: These ones are a bit more complicated, so they get their own chunk
```{r}
# Ensure factor levels are correctly defined
data_waves124 <- data_waves124 |>
  mutate(
    H1TO17 = factor(H1TO17, levels = c("(0) (0) Never", "(1) (1) Every day/almost every day", 
                                       "(2) (2) 2 or 3 days/week", "(3) (3) 1 or 2 days/week", 
                                       "(4) (4) 2 or 3 days/month", "(5) (5) Once a month or less (3-12 times in past 12 months)", 
                                       "(6) (6) 1 or 2 days in past 12 months", "(7) (7) Never")),
    H2ED19 = factor(H2ED19, levels = c("(1) (1) Strongly agree", "(2) (2) Agree", 
                                       "(3) (3) Neither agree nor disagree", "(4) (4) Disagree", 
                                       "(5) (5) Strongly disagree")),
    H2ED17 = factor(H2ED17, levels = c("(1) (1) Strongly agree", "(2) (2) Agree", 
                                       "(3) (3) Neither agree nor disagree", "(4) (4) Disagree", 
                                       "(5) (5) Strongly disagree")),
    H2PR1 = factor(H2PR1, levels = c("(1) (1) Not at all", "(2) (2) Very little", 
                                     "(3) (3) Somewhat", "(4) (4) Quite a bit", "(5) (5) Very much")),
    H2PR2 = factor(H2PR2, levels = c("(1) (1) Not at all", "(2) (2) Very little", 
                                     "(3) (3) Somewhat", "(4) (4) Quite a bit", "(5) (5) Very much")),
    H2PR3 = factor(H2PR3, levels = c("(1) (1) Not at all", "(2) (2) Very little", 
                                     "(3) (3) Somewhat", "(4) (4) Quite a bit", "(5) (5) Very much")),
    H2PR4 = factor(H2PR4, levels = c("(1) (1) Not at all", "(2) (2) Very little", 
                                     "(3) (3) Somewhat", "(4) (4) Quite a bit", "(5) (5) Very much"))

### Step 4: Check that the composites were created successfully

```{r,eval=F,include=T}
summary(data_waves124)
```

## Some tables to preview the composite variables we made :)

```{r,echo=F,include=TRUE}
# Extract the data for display
display_composites1 <- head(data_waves124[, c(1, 27:31)])
display_composites2 <- head(data_waves124[, c(1, 32:36)])
display_composites3 <- head(data_waves124[, c(1, 37:41)])

# Use knitr::kable to create a table
knitr::kable(display_composites1)
knitr::kable(display_composites2)
knitr::kable(display_composites3)
```
